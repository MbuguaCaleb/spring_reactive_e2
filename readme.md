**Reactive Programming**

```yaml

In reactive programming i work with events unlike in a traditional
Rest api where i have to wait for the whole request response cycle.


Normal Rest API use what we call servlet and the server used in normal
rest api is called tomcat.


For reactive applications the server used is called netty.


In Reactive apporoach we return a stream of events.

This is done by a Flux Pipeline which is a Publisher.

Flux is a Pipe through which i can push events.


A reactive applications can fetch requests progressively as they come unlike
a transitional application..

It is therefore very important to use a reactive client side to fetch the requests.
